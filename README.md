This Todo application demonstrates a clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend, with the frontend handling presentation logic and the backend managing data persistence and business logic. The RESTful API design allows for easy communication between the two layers, and the use of modern frameworks (Spring Boot and Next.js) ensures a robust and maintainable codebase.
